# "Hey Rodney, â€¦ " backend application

Process voice commands (after speech-to-text conversion), and evaluate and execute resulting commands.

For more information see: [drogue-iot/hey-rodney](https://github.com/drogue-iot/hey-rodney).

## ToDo's

* [ ] Currently, commands get executed in the same container, but execute some command line tool.

  Ideally there should be some kind of "command execution service", which processes the results.
